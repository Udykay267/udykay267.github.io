      <h3>Project 8: UltraNote Backend Optimization</h3>
      <p>UltraNote Backend Optimization is a performance-focused backend enhancement initiative aimed at improving the responsiveness, stability, and scalability of a note-sharing and collaboration platform.
		Originally built with PHP and MySQL, the backend faced performance bottlenecks as user volume grew. As the lead backend engineer, you refactored large portions of the codebase, implemented optimized database queries, restructured API response handling, and introduced caching mechanisms.
		The result was a 50% improvement in API response time and 30% reduction in server load, enabling the platform to handle thousands of concurrent note operations (create, update, share, delete) with greater consistency and reliability.</p>
      <p><strong>Tech Used:</strong>PHP 7+, MySQL, InnoDB, indexed columns, Custom RESTful PHP endpoints
		OPcache, query optimization, caching, Custom logs, PHP profiler, Postman, phpMyAdmin
